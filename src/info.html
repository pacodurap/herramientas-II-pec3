                        <p>Originating in the mid-1960s among British and American musicians, the sound of psychedelic
                            rock
                            invokes three core effects of LSD: depersonalization, dechronicization, and dynamization,
                            all of
                            which detach the user from reality.[2] Musically, the effects may be represented via novelty
                            studio tricks, electronic or non-Western instrumentation, disjunctive song structures, and
                            extended instrumental segments.[3] Some of the earlier 1960s psychedelic rock musicians were
                            based in folk, jazz, and the blues, while others showcased an explicit Indian classical
                            influence called "raga rock". In the 1960s, there existed two main variants of the genre:
                            the
                            more whimsical, surrealist British psychedelia and the harder American West Coast acid rock.
                            While "acid rock" is sometimes deployed interchangeably with the term "psychedelic rock", it
                            also refers more specifically to the heavier and more extreme ends of the genre.</p>

                        <p>The peak years of psychedelic rock were between 1967 and 1969, with milestone events
                            including
                            the 1967 Summer of Love and the 1969 Woodstock Rock Festival, becoming an international
                            musical
                            movement associated with a widespread counterculture before beginning a decline as changing
                            attitudes, the loss of some key individuals, and a back-to-basics movement led surviving
                            performers to move into new musical areas. The genre bridged the transition from early blues
                            and
                            folk-based rock to progressive rock and hard rock, and as a result contributed to the
                            development of sub-genres such as heavy metal. Since the late 1970s it has been revived in
                            various forms of neo-psychedelia.</p>
